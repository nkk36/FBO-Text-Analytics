# README

**How to Run:** Clone this repo and run script.R in the main directory. I usually write R code in one script broken up into sections which you can expand or collapse as described [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200484568-Code-Folding-and-Sections). 

## Data

You can either run the FedBizOpps Scraper that I got from GSA's GitHub [here](https://github.com/GSA/fbo-scraper) or you can contact me at nkallfa36@gmail.com for the raw data which is about 400MB in total. I did not want to crowd out my repo by including the data here.
